# calaccess-interface-notes
Documentation on the interfaces to the California Secretary of States's CalAccess system.

Official documentation from the California Secretary of State can be found within the pack of files released at:

     https://campaignfinance.cdn.sos.ca.gov/dbwebexport.zip

Information from this official documentation will be appearing in this repository, allowing anyone to comment on,
discuss problems with and suggest improvements to the official documentation. And we do not have to wait for the
Secretary of State to release new documentation in order to find new information.

But this will only work if people contribute. Please consider doing so, as dynamic documentation will help all of us.
This does not all have to be a zero-sum game.
